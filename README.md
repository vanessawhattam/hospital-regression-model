## Categorical data for Cunningham
Your new assignment requires you to build one multiple regression model. For this analysis, Randall Cunningham would like you to use Python. Your previous assignment required you to build a regression model using numerical data. This new assignment requires you to utilize categorical variables as independent variables. Once again, use [calihospital.txt](/data/calihostpital.txt).

The following are the requirements of your project:
* Use the following variables as independent variables and create dummy variables for all of them: (4 pts.)
  * `Teaching`
  * `DonorType`
  * `Gender`
  * `PositionTitle`
  * `Compensation`
  * `TypeControl`
* Bin the variable `AvlBeds` and create a categorical variable. (2 pts.)
* Use both `Operating Income` and `Operating Revenue` as dependent variables, and build two separate models (2 pts.)

Interpret your findings for these models.
1. Which model performs better and which variables are included and others are not (1 pt.)
2. Provide the interpretation of your variables and whether the results make sense (1 pt.)
